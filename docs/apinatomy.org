* ApiNATOMY to RDF/OWL2 conversion
** Basic strategy
   JSON -> RDF -> OWL2
   Conversion from json to rdf should have few if any changes in semantics.
   Conversion from a direct rdf translation to OWL2 is where the semantic
   translation of ApiNATOMY structures into OWL2 constructs will happen.
* Export
Make sure SciGraph services and InterLex are accessible for OntTerm.

Run this block in emacs with =C-c C-c= or tangle and run with the block below

#+begin_src python :dir ../ :results output :tangle ../export-apinatomy-tests
# note have to export to working dir not ../bin/ because
# there is no test folder inside of bin and python can't

You can also tangle this file to produce [[file:../export-apinatomy-tests]]
and then run that file from the working directory of this sparc-curation repo.
#+begin_src bash
emacs --batch \
      --load org \
      --load ob-shell \
      --load ob-python \
      --eval '(org-babel-tangle-file "./docs/apinatomy.org")'
./export-apinatomy-tests
#+end_src

#+options: p:t

* PLAN 2023-08-04 :future:
- NPO hasInstanceInTaxon
- alpha :: NPO synaptic connectivity
- maybe :: NPO connections from composer
- stretch :: ApiNATOMY species variance for whole models where not covered by NPO
- if-needed :: vagus round 2
* PLAN 2023-05-12 :future:
- NPO partial orders
- vagus round 1
- ApiNATOMY models use wbrcm
- NPO additional connections from NLP
* RC 2023-04-12
- NPO add populations from NLP mmset4
- NPO partial orders for NPO populations
- NPO add forwardConnectionPhenotype axioms (synaptic connectivity) to ApiNATOMY populations
- NPO add hasTargetOrgan annotations for sanity check competency queries to ApiNATOMY populations
* PROD 2023-01-23
CLOSED: <2023-02-16 Thu>
- curation-export fix protocols.io api v3 v4
- sparc-community-terms sync from dashboard terms, avoid duplicate ontology class definitions
- SciGraph services new dynamic endpoints
  - =/dynamic/prod/npo/hasTaxon/{id}=
  - =/dynamic/prod/sparc/phenotypeAnatomy/{id}=
* RC 2023-01-17
- ApiNATOMY wbrcm new layers in certain lyphs and corrected hosting regions
- protcur.ttl now includes values from the sparc simple page note curation workflow
* PROD 2022-12-02
CLOSED: <2022-12-20 Tue>
- ApiNATOMY add model wbrcm for real this time
* RC 2022-11-28
- ApiNATOMY added model pancreas
- ApiNATOMY aacar-6 fixed axon locations
- ApiNATOMY bromo replaced FMA ids with UBERON and ILX ids
- ApiNATOMY models now contain version information in the form of a
  checksum on their input model ([[./queries.org::#apinat-models][example query]]).
- ApiNATOMY schema change =inheritedExternal -> inheritedOntologyTerms=
  =inheritedExternal= still exists and may appear in some models,
  however ontology terms now only show up under =inheritedOntologyTerms=
  and are no longer included in =inheritedExternals=.
- NPO added ebm sparc-nlp (replaces ebm nerves)
- NPO removed ebm nerves
- NPO aacar added hasInstanceInTaxon axioms
- NPO kblad added hasInstanceInTaxon axioms
- Blazegraph/SciGraph loaded graphs now embed information about
  build provenance that can be used to identify the version of a graph.
  See [[./queries.org::#embedded-load-provenance-record][embedded load provenance record]] for examples.

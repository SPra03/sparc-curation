# About Simple SCKAN

* Simple SCKAN refers to an extension of the SCKAN that incorporates simplified relations in order to support simpler queries on basic connectivity knowledge available in NPO using query languages like SPARQL or Cypher.
* We have setup STARDOG as a SPARQL query interface to query over the NPO/SCKAN connectivity information
    * This interface is intended for the users like NLP curators to check whether a connection exists between regions based on a set of neuron populations in NPO
        * The connections that we thought would be useful are the soma, axon, and dendrite locations as well as axon terminal and axon sensory terminal locations.
        * We have a set of predefined canned query patterns in STARDOG that we think would be useful for the NLP curators.
* What to expect in the future:
    * Have the simplified NPO graph available via SciGraph so that the SciGraph users can develop different tools and apps based on simpler queries using SPARQL or Cypher.
    * We also want to have the Stardog interface available for broader audience who would prefer a simpler way to query SCKAN connectivity knowledge.

* Graph load and deployment

To load the graph run the following from the folder of this readme.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
ontload graph \
--org SciCrunch  ${IFS# github organization} \
NIF-Ontology     ${IFS# repo name} \
NIF              ${IFS# remote base http:// pattern to swap with local file://,
                   NIF automatically expands to http://ontology.neuinfo.org/NIF} \
--zip-location /tmp/test1  ${IFS# output folder where the loaded graph zip will be exported} \
--git-local /tmp/test1     ${IFS# location where git repo will be cloned} \
--branch dev               ${IFS# git ref (branch, commit, etc.) from which to build} \
--patch                    ${IFS# do apply patches} \
--graphload-config ./graphload.yaml  # path to the graphload config (only graphload.yaml.template needs to exist)
#+END_SRC

To create services.yaml run the following from the folder of this readme.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
scigraph-deploy config \
localhost                 ${IFS# build host} \
scigraph.scicrunch.io     ${IFS# services host} \
--services-user ec2-user  ${IFS# user on the services host} \
--zip-location ./         ${IFS# local path to build files (not sure why
                            we need this for deploying the config)} \
--local                   ${IFS# run all commands locally} \
--services-config ./services.yaml  # path to services config (only services.yaml.template needs to exist)
#+END_SRC

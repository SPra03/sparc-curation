* Graph load and deployment

To load the graph run the following from the folder of this readme.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
ontload graph \
--org SciCrunch \  # github organization
NIF-Ontology \  # repo name
NIF \  # remote base http:// pattern to swap with local file://, NIF automatically expands to http://ontology.neuinfo.org/NIF
--zip-location /tmp/test1 \  # output folder where the loaded graph zip will be exported
--git-local /tmp/test1 \  # location where git repo will be cloned
--branch dev \  # git ref (branch, commit, etc.) from which to build
--patch \  # do apply patches
--graphload-config ./graphload.yaml  # path to the graphload config (only graphload.yaml.template needs to exist)
#+END_SRC

To create services.yaml run the following from the folder of this readme.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
scigraph-deploy config \
localhost \  # build host
scigraph.scicrunch.io \  # services host
--services-user ec2-user \  # user on the services host
--zip-location ./ \  # local path to build files (not sure why we need this for deploying the config)
--local \  # run all commands locally
--services-config ./services.yaml  # path to services config (only services.yaml.template needs to exist)
#+END_SRC
